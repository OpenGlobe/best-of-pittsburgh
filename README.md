## Things to do 

[Quantum Theatre] (http://www.quantumtheatre.com/chatterton/)

[The Carnegie International](https://cmoa.org/exhibition/carnegie-international-2018/) is amazing -  the art in previous years has been phenomenal, with fantastic curators. 


# Networking

[The City of Pittsburgh](http://pittsburghpa.gov/servepgh/cla/) provides a great intro to the area, through the mayor's office.  It's a tour of the city agenies, behind the scenes, and generally includes a great and diverse group of attendees.  I did it a couple of years ago.

[The Shop](http://theshop.org/) is a cool place in homewood that has open community forums every week/month (i forget) that are supposed to be amazing


[Beauty Shoppe](https://beautyshoppe.co/regions/pittsburgh/) for coworking. 
 
# A bit of shopping

I love the [East-End Co-op](https://www.eastendfood.coop/) for eggs, meat, and milk.  Their veggies are decent, but expensive.

There are farmers markets till october downtown (thursdays), sq. hill (sunday) and bloomfield on Sat.  You'll find one that you like that fits your schedule.  Pigeon Bagels, and who cooks for you farms are in sq. hill and bloomfield.  They have the best bagels in pgh, and who cooks for you has phenomenal produce.

If fish is your thing, consider [Penn Avenue Fish Co.](http://www.pennavefishcompany.com/)

While you're there, get some cheese [here](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pennsylvania-macaroni-co-pittsburgh-2)
